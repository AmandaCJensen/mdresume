Love Learning (this is a developing strength as I have not really put the time in for my desire to learn)

When I was growing up I was always complimented as being smart which was a good thing and a bad thing. Good because I was encouraged to get good grades to continue this perception that they had of me. Bad because I received those complements for my natural capabilities, and no effort I had put in previously. This turned into a little bit of a problem where I wouldn't really try to learn as much because I was suppose to be smart. I was suppose to be the kid that knew everything, and if I studied then I wasn't really smart is the misconception that I construed in my mind.
